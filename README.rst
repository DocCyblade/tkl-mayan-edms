Mayan EDMS - An electronic vault for your documents 
===================================================

`Mayan EDMS`_ is a Free Open Source Electronic Document Management System,
coded in the Python language using the Django web application framework 
and released under the Apache 2.0 License. It provides an electronic vault
or repository for electronic documents.

This appliance includes all the standard features in `TurnKey Core`_:

- Mayan EDMS 3.1.9 installed via PIP from `PyPI`_ into virtualenv within
  /opt/mayan-edms

  **Security note**: Updates to Mayan EDMS may require supervision so
  they **ARE NOT** configured to install automatically. See below for
  updating Mayan EDMS.

- Includes all pre-reqs: Virtualenv/Django/Gunicorn/Celery/Redis/Supervisor
- SSL support out of the box.
- PostgreSQL is is installed as Mayan's backend database 
- `Adminer`_ administration frontend for PostgreSQL (listening on
  port 12322 - uses SSL).
- Nginx configured as reverse proxy for Mayan WebUI.
- Webmin modules for configuring PostgreSQL.

Note: as of v15.0 build of Mayan-EDMS appliance, Mayan now uses environment
variables to provide config settings. A convenience copy of these can be found
at /etc/mayan/env. This makes it easier to run the mayan-edms commandline tool.
For example::

    ENV=/etc/mayan/env
    BIN=/opt/mayan-edms/bin
    su - mayan -c ". $ENV && $BIN/mayan-edms.py help"
